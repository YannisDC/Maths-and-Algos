# Maths and Algos
A collection of toy problems that have to do wit maths or interesting algorithms in different programming languages.


## Tarjan's Algorithm for Strongly Connected Components (Swift Playground)
I translated the explanation of [William Fisset](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wUgWX0nc4NY) to Swift Playground along with some extra prints to follow along what's happening.

## Hilbert (Python)
This idea literally came from a [3Blue1Brown video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3s7h2MHQtxc) asking what would be the best way to turn a picture to sound and how Hilbert curves can help with this.

## Collatz Conjecture (Python)
Collatz Conjecture is very easy to explain yet very hard to proof mathematically. This is just some spielerei to find any patterns.
